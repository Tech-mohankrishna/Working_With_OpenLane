# OPENLANE

## :book: ABOUT THE REPOSITORY
OpenLane is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, CVC, SPEF-Extractor, KLayout and a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization. The flow performs all ASIC implementation steps from RTL all the way down to GDSII.

You can check out the documentation, including in-depth guides and reference manuals at [ReadTheDocs](https://openlane.readthedocs.io/).

# RTL to GDS2 Flow
The process from RTL (Register-Transfer Level) to GDS2 (Graphic Data System 2) in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design involves several complex steps, each of which plays a crucial role in transforming a high-level hardware description into a final physical layout that can be fabricated as an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit). Here's a detailed breakdown of these steps:
