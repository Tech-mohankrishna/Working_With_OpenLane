# OpenLane

OpenLane is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, CVC, SPEF-Extractor, KLayout and a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization. The flow performs all ASIC implementation steps from RTL all the way down to GDSII.

You can check out the documentation, including in-depth guides and reference manuals at [ReadTheDocs](https://openlane.readthedocs.io/).
